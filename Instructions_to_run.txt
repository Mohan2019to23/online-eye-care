How to use the chart

go to the online eye care folder(where the system is)
Make sure you are using a desktop computer.
Position yourself approximatelly 1 metre from your computer screen,facing it directly and cover one eye
if you enter all directions correctly youll progress to the next test
If you entered two letters wrongly youll be taken through your results
If you make a mistake from your clicking rather than your vision, you can always redo the test
Once youve reached your result ,repeat the process for your right eye
